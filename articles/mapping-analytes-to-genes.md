# Non-1:1 Relationships in the SomaScan Menu

*This R package is an in-development resource and is research use only.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

The SomaScan menu contains instances of non-1:1 relationships between
SOMAmer^(®) Reagents and their target proteins. In simple terms, this
means there is sometimes not a perfect, singular line that can be drawn
between one SOMAmer Reagent, its target protein, and the gene that
transcribes it. This is a unique characteristic of SomaScan, stemming
from the biological complexity and diversity of the proteome.
Understanding and handling these non-1:1 relationships can be a crucial
processing step for pathway analysis, particularly when using tools or
methods developed for gene-based (transcriptomic) data.

This vignette will explain why these relationships are relevant to
pathway analysis, and demonstrate how the tools in SomaEnrich can be
used to streamline a pathway analysis workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How SomaScan Measures Proteins

To better understand non-1:1 relationships in the SomaScan menu, and how
their presence shapes data analysis, it first helps to know how the
assay works.

SOMAmer Reagents bind to three-dimensional protein structures, like
epitopes, and are conceptually similar to monoclonal antibodies in
immunoassays. Because SomaScan measures specific structural features,
rather than entire proteins, a single protein can be detected by
multiple SOMAmer Reagents if it contains multiple distinct binding
structures.

So, for example, the following 1:many pattern could be observed in the
data:

    Protein 1 ____ SOMAmer Reagent 1
            |_____ SOMAmer Reagent 2
            |_____ SOMAmer Reagent 3

This differs from non-affinity-based protein measurement technologies
like mass spectrometry, where measurements typically correspond more
directly to individual proteins or genes.

With this context in mind, the remainder of this vignette will use
example SomaScan data and R code to show what non-1:1 relationships look
like in the data, how they impact gene-based analyses like GSEA, and
options for handling them.

### Load R Packages

``` r

library(SomaDataIO)
library(SomaEnrich)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
```

### Prepare for GSEA

In pre-ranked GSEA, an ordered statistical metric is required, often
derived from the results of differential expression analysis. This can
be pulled from the
[`SomaEnrich::t_tests`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/t_tests.md)
data set. The t_stat will be used as the ranking metric - please note
that this may not be the best metric for your experiment, and is merely
used here as an example.

Entrez gene symbols will be used as vector names, to match the gene set
networks already available in SomaEnrich. Below is a subset of the
`t_tests` data set, sorted by \|t_stat\|:

``` r

t_tests |>
    select(SeqId, EntrezGeneSymbol, t_stat) |>
    arrange(desc(abs(t_stat))) |>
    head(n = 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 3
    ##    SeqId    EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat
    ##    <chr>    <chr>             <dbl>
    ##  1 8468-19  KLK3             -14.5 
    ##  2 6580-29  PZP               14.3 
    ##  3 21232-39 KLK3             -13.4 
    ##  4 7926-13  SPINT3           -13.3 
    ##  5 13699-6  KLK3             -10.8 
    ##  6 4330-4   KLK3              -9.94
    ##  7 3032-11  CGA|FSHB           9.53
    ##  8 16892-23 ENPP2              8.86
    ##  9 2953-31  CGA|LHB            8.71
    ## 10 5763-67  DEFB104A          -8.14

Every `SeqId` in the above table is unique. However, some genes, like
Prostate-Specific Antigen (KLK3), appear multiple times in the
“EntrezGeneSymbol” column. This illustrates a 1:many (i.e. non-1:1)
relationship between KLK3 and `SeqIds` in the data.

If Entrez gene symbols are solely used to identify each data point in
the ranked vector, an input vector for GSEA could look like this:

``` r

rank_vec <- t_tests$t_stat
names(rank_vec) <- t_tests$EntrezGeneSymbol

rank_vec[1:10]
```

    ##       KLK3        PZP       KLK3     SPINT3       KLK3       KLK3 
    ## -14.541600  14.285305 -13.369361 -13.307083 -10.835849  -9.940982 
    ##   CGA|FSHB      ENPP2    CGA|LHB   DEFB104A 
    ##   9.528913   8.862328   8.709291  -8.141046

In the top example entries alone, some gene names are seen more than
once, and combined gene entities with a “\|” character are present in
the vector names. Both of these patterns are unique to SomaScan-derived
data and can complicate the GSEA workflow.

In particular, the presence of duplicate entries may have unintended
consequences for GSEA, if not corrected, as it violates one of the core
assumptions of GSEA.

### Assumptions of GSEA

A critical assumption of the GSEA algorithm is that 1:1 mapping is
present between ranked entries and biological entities, and that each
gene in the ranked list is only represented once (A. Subramanian 2005;
“GSEA Software Documentation” 2026). Violations of this assumption can
disproportionately weight genes during calculation of the enrichment
score, resulting in the following undesirable effects:

- Hits (highly-ranked genes found in a gene set) could be counted
  multiple times
- Incidences of multiple counting could create inflated enrichment
  scores
- Enrichment scores for small gene sets could be especially distorted

The non-1:1 gene:SOMAmer Reagent relationships in the SomaScan menu
stress this assumption when using SomaScan-derived ranking statistics
for GSEA.

### SOMAmer Reagent Targets

In a SomaScan data set, SOMAmer Reagents and `SeqIds` have a 1:1
relationship, where each `SeqId` uniquely identifies a single SOMAmer
reagent. However, as described earlier in this document, *proteins* do
not necessarily have a 1:1 relationship with a single SOMAmer Reagent.
In these cases, external identifiers like the UniProt ID (or gene ID)
may not fully distinguish the exact target structure of a SOMAmer
Reagent.

For example, as observed earlier, the KLK3 gene appears in the 11K
SomaScan menu multiple times:

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 5
    ##   SeqId    TargetFullName               Target UniProt EntrezGeneSymbol
    ##   <chr>    <chr>                        <chr>  <chr>   <chr>           
    ## 1 13699-6  Prostate-specific antigen    PSA    P07288  KLK3            
    ## 2 21232-39 Benign Prostate specific An… BPSA   P07288  KLK3            
    ## 3 4330-4   Prostate-specific antigen    PSA    P07288  KLK3            
    ## 4 8468-19  Prostate-specific antigen    PSA    P07288  KLK3

All 3 `SeqIds` in the above table are unique, but the other values are
(for the most part) identical. In the `example_data_11k` ADAT, all these
unique analytes are present, each with a distinct RFU measurement:

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 5
    ##    SampleId seq.13699.6 seq.21232.39 seq.4330.4 seq.8468.19
    ##    <chr>          <dbl>        <dbl>      <dbl>       <dbl>
    ##  1 23              898.        3642.       377.       2088.
    ##  2 119             182.         320        141.        368.

    ##  6 51              334.         505        182.        424.
    ##  7 174             171.         376.       158.        912.
    ##  8 177             314.         397.       164.        379.
    ##  9 147             642.        2355.       315.       1655.
    ## 10 86              204.         329.       120.        373.

In `t_tests`, multiple analytes targeting KLK3 were (after sorting)
located near the bottom of the ranked gene vector.

So, let’s return to the example vector we made for pre-ranked GSEA.
Proceeding with this vector as-is may have the following unintended
effects:

- KLK3 appears multiple times in the ranked vector, potentially leading
  to over-representation of KLK3 in the final GSEA results
  - This effect applies to any other duplicated entities in the vector
- The vector elements with “\|”-delimited names will not match gene
  symbols in the available GO or MSigDB resources, and consequently will
  be counted as a “miss” in the enrichment score calculation, rather
  than a hit
  - This can result in inaccurate counting of these highly-ranked
    entities in the final enrichment results

Solutions for both of these points are implemented by SomaEnrich, and
will be described in greater detail below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Solutions in SomaEnrich

The functions in SomaEnrich automatically handle instances of 1:many
mapping between SOMAmer Reagents (and therefore, SomaScan measurements)
and external gene or protein identifiers.

SomaEnrich provides functions that perform:

1.  Data cleaning operations, to split apart delimited identifiers that
    signify protein heterodimers
2.  Measurement filtering and selection, to resolve non-1:1 mapping for
    gene-based analyses like GSEA

The following sections will explain how functions in SomaEnrich handle
these scenarios.

### Working with Heterodimers and “\|” Delimiters

The SomaScan menu contains instances where a “\|” character is used to
delineate two (or more) gene or protein identifiers. This notation
indicates that a given SOMAmer Reagent binds a heterodimer protein or
larger protein heterocomplex, where the protein subunits originate from
different genes. To fully capture this information in the menu, all
genes with protein products in the complex are separated by a delimiter
character, typically “\|”.

However, the biological knowledge bases typically used by popular
pathway analysis tools, like GO and KEGG, were developed for
gene-centric data, and do not contain this type of annotation.

When performing GSEA, all identifiers used for analysis inputs should be
of consistent type, and in the same format. By default, SomaEnrich uses
Entrez gene symbols for both GO and MSigDB gene sets; therefore, the
gene symbols in the ranked input vector must be compatible Entrez gene
symbols. Because this heterodimer gene notation is unique to SomaScan,
genes delimited by “\|” will not be compatible with the entries in GO
and MSigDB. Consequently, any gene in the input vector not found in the
gene set will contribute to the negative increment of the running sum
statistic, but will not be removed from the data set (A. Subramanian
2005). This can affect the calculation of the enrichment score - if a
highly-ranked gene *should* contribute to the running sum, but can’t be
correctly matched to any member of the gene set, the enrichment
contribution from that gene will not be adequately captured.

To ensure consistency in gene symbols across both input ranks and gene
sets, delimited identifiers are split prior to analysis (see the
`split_ids` argument of
[`SomaEnrich::somaPrGSEA()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/somaPrGSEA.md)).

Here’s a preview of the first 10 rows of data, without the splitting
operation:

``` r

# Prior to split
t_tests |>
    select(AptName, EntrezGeneSymbol, t_stat) |>
    head(n = 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 3
    ##    AptName      EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat
    ##    <chr>        <chr>             <dbl>
    ##  1 seq.8468.19  KLK3             -14.5 
    ##  2 seq.6580.29  PZP               14.3 
    ##  3 seq.21232.39 KLK3             -13.4 
    ##  4 seq.7926.13  SPINT3           -13.3 
    ##  5 seq.13699.6  KLK3             -10.8 
    ##  6 seq.4330.4   KLK3              -9.94
    ##  7 seq.3032.11  CGA|FSHB           9.53
    ##  8 seq.16892.23 ENPP2              8.86
    ##  9 seq.2953.31  CGA|LHB            8.71
    ## 10 seq.5763.67  DEFB104A          -8.14

And here is that same data post-split:

``` r

t_tests_split <- t_tests |>
    select(AptName, EntrezGeneSymbol, t_stat) |>
    mutate(row_id = row_number()) |>
    tidyr::separate_rows(EntrezGeneSymbol, sep = "\\|")

head(t_tests_split, n = 12)
```

    ## # A tibble: 12 × 4
    ##    AptName      EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat row_id
    ##    <chr>        <chr>             <dbl>  <int>
    ##  1 seq.8468.19  KLK3             -14.5       1
    ##  2 seq.6580.29  PZP               14.3       2
    ##  3 seq.21232.39 KLK3             -13.4       3
    ##  4 seq.7926.13  SPINT3           -13.3       4
    ##  5 seq.13699.6  KLK3             -10.8       5
    ##  6 seq.4330.4   KLK3              -9.94      6
    ##  7 seq.3032.11  CGA                9.53      7
    ##  8 seq.3032.11  FSHB               9.53      7
    ##  9 seq.16892.23 ENPP2              8.86      8
    ## 10 seq.2953.31  CGA                8.71      9
    ## 11 seq.2953.31  LHB                8.71      9
    ## 12 seq.5763.67  DEFB104A          -8.14     10

This splitting procedure can have the following effects:

1.  Splitting the heterodimers requires duplicating the ranking metric
    value, which can introduce ties to the ranked vector
2.  Splitting the heterodimers can contribute to instances of gene name
    duplication in the ranked input vector

Let’s use the table above to better illustrate the first point. The
following analyte, `seq.4914.10`, maps to 3 Entrez gene symbols:

``` r

t_tests |>
    dplyr::select(AptName, SeqId, Target, EntrezGeneSymbol, t_stat) |>
    filter(AptName == "seq.4914.10")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 5
    ##   AptName     SeqId   Target EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat
    ##   <chr>       <chr>   <chr>  <chr>             <dbl>
    ## 1 seq.4914.10 4914-10 HCG    CGA|CGB3|CGB7      7.90

The string `CGA|CGB3|CGB7` is unlikely to be matched in any gene-based
database, so the string must be split into its constituent parts:

``` r

t_tests |>
    dplyr::select(AptName, SeqId, Target, EntrezGeneSymbol, t_stat) |>
    filter(AptName == "seq.4914.10") |>
    tidyr::separate_rows(EntrezGeneSymbol, sep = "\\|")
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 5
    ##   AptName     SeqId   Target EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat
    ##   <chr>       <chr>   <chr>  <chr>             <dbl>
    ## 1 seq.4914.10 4914-10 HCG    CGA                7.90
    ## 2 seq.4914.10 4914-10 HCG    CGB3               7.90
    ## 3 seq.4914.10 4914-10 HCG    CGB7               7.90

Now, if we were to use the t_stat as input into
[`somaPrGSEA()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/somaPrGSEA.md),
the input would look like this:

    ##      CGA     CGB3     CGB7 
    ## 7.895289 7.895289 7.895289

The genes are unique, but the actual values used for ranking the genes
are the same. This can produce a warning during GSEA, stating that the
ranking vector has ties. Essentially, these 3 elements can’t be ranked
properly, because they all have the same ranking value. While this is
typically undesirable if it occurs in the raw, unmodified ranking
vector, the decision to split heterodimers during pre-processing can
itself create ties. This is *expected* behavior when splitting SomaScan
heterodimers.

### Multiple Targets Map to One Gene

Let’s move on to the second unintended effect of splitting heterodimers:
it can contribute to instances of gene name duplication in the ranked
input vector. This may result in \>1 value per `AptName`, with a unique
gene symbol for each value. Take `3032-11`, for example; prior to the
split operation, it possesses one t_stat value:

``` r

filter(t_tests, AptName == "seq.3032.11") |>
    select(AptName, EntrezGeneSymbol, t_stat)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   AptName     EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat
    ##   <chr>       <chr>             <dbl>
    ## 1 seq.3032.11 CGA|FSHB           9.53

Post-split, the t_stat value for `3032-11` is split across multiple
rows.

``` r

filter(t_tests_split, AptName == "seq.3032.11")
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 4
    ##   AptName     EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat row_id
    ##   <chr>       <chr>             <dbl>  <int>
    ## 1 seq.3032.11 CGA                9.53      7
    ## 2 seq.3032.11 FSHB               9.53      7

Because genes like CGA can be mapped to \>1 SOMAmer Reagent, the above
step produces multiple t_stat values for CGA, when viewed in combination
with the rest of the data set:

``` r

filter(t_tests_split, EntrezGeneSymbol == "CGA")
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 4
    ##   AptName     EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat row_id
    ##   <chr>       <chr>             <dbl>  <int>
    ## 1 seq.3032.11 CGA               9.53       7
    ## 2 seq.2953.31 CGA               8.71       9
    ## 3 seq.4914.10 CGA               7.90      12
    ## 4 seq.14056.4 CGA               3.34     128
    ## 5 seq.3521.16 CGA              -0.409   4853

All of these values are associated with the gene CGA, but it’s best
practice to not use this vector as-is for GSEA. To avoid duplication of
gene identifiers, only one t_stat value for CGA will be chosen. But why
only choose one, and how should it be selected?

### Selecting One Measurement per Gene

In transcriptomics, it’s common practice to combine transcript or
probe-based measurements and sum them to obtain gene-level counts. When
performing GSEA with SomaScan data, it may be tempting to apply this
methodology and, for example, sum together all measurements from
analytes mapping to CGA or KLK3. This would produce one single
measurement for each gene and resolve the identifier duplication problem
described previously.

However, it is *not* advised to collapse or aggregate analytes into a
single entity based on their protein target or gene. Instead, it is
standard practice to keep SomaScan measurements **distinct** whenever
possible.

If each SOMAmer Reagent is measuring a different isoform or region of a
protein, collapsing these data points may lose valuable information
about those protein regions. Instead, it is recommended to treat each
analyte as an independent measurement, and select a single “best”
measurement to be *representative* of each protein (or, in this case,
gene) when multiple measurements are present.

But what constitutes the “best” measurement? This can can vary depending
on experiment and ranking metric used for pre-ranked GSEA. SomaEnrich
provides a few different methods to make this selection.

Let’s return to the KLK3 example; we will sort the KLK3 analytes by our
chosen ranking metric (t_stat):

``` r

filter(t_tests, EntrezGeneSymbol == ex_gene) |>
    select(AptName, EntrezGeneSymbol, t_stat) |>
    arrange(desc(t_stat))
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 3
    ##   AptName      EntrezGeneSymbol t_stat
    ##   <chr>        <chr>             <dbl>
    ## 1 seq.4330.4   KLK3              -9.94
    ## 2 seq.13699.6  KLK3             -10.8 
    ## 3 seq.21232.39 KLK3             -13.4 
    ## 4 seq.8468.19  KLK3             -14.5

The “top” KLK3-associated analyte (sorted by t_stat) is seq.4330.4. If
we follow the recommendation to retain one measurement per gene and
arbitrarily choose the first occurrence, only this t_stat value for KLK3
will be used for input into GSEA, and the others will be lost. However,
this can have unintended consequences. What if we’re interested in the
value with the largest *magnitude*, regardless of sign? Or what if the
selected ranking metric is a p-value? The same sorting method may not
work for both p-values (where the smallest value is preferred) and fold
change values (where the largest absolute value is preferred).

Merely sorting in ascending/descending order and choosing the first
occurrence may not return the expected result.

### Selection Methods in SomaEnrich

SomaEnrich performs this sorting and selection step under the hood in
[`somaPrGSEA()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/somaPrGSEA.md)
via the `resolve_multimapping` argument. When
`resolve_multimapping = TRUE` (the default), the function will create a
catalog of all unique genes present in a ranked data frame, identify all
SOMAmer Reagents associated with each gene, and select a single analyte
based on a user-defined criteria. By default, the statistic with the
largest absolute value is retained. This ensures that each protein
target/gene is only represented once in the data set, **without**
collapsing values to create a single summed measurement.

However, like mentioned previously, this sorting method may not be
appropriate for all ranking metrics. The following measurement sorting
and filtering methods are supported:

- Filtering by **absolute value** (the default): the largest absolute
  value is chosen (ignores sign)
- Filtering by **maximum**: the maximum value is chosen
- Filtering by **minimum**: the minimum value is chosen
- Filtering by **rank**: the smallest rank is chosen using pre-sorted
  data

For more complex sorting (i.e. using two or more sorting criteria), the
“rank” method may be more appropriate. After sorting by the desired
criteria, like a combination of FC and p-value in a single-sided test, a
rank is assigned to the input values, using the order in which they were
sorted in. The first value is ranked 1. In cases of multimapping, the
value with the *lowest* rank is retained.

Please note that selection by “rank” and “minimum” can produce
*different* results! Filtering by rank selects based on position in the
input vector (given pre-sorting), while filtering by minimum selects
based on actual numeric value, and can be impacted by the presence of
negative values when the metric is signed. Similarly, depending on how
the pre-sorting is done, “maximum” and “rank” can select either the same
or different values. Ultimately, filtering by rank may lose
information - the magnitude of difference in values is ignored, and
proximity to the start of the vector is prioritized. Alternatively, if
selecting by absolute value, magnitude of signal is prioritized, while
directionality (i.e. sign) is lost.

The chunk below shows how the available sorting options can identify
different values for fictional `GENE_A`:

``` r

gene_a <- c(GENE_A = 0.01, GENE_A = -0.5, GENE_A = 5, GENE_A = -10)

max(gene_a)
```

    ## [1] 5

``` r

min(gene_a)
```

    ## [1] -10

``` r

max(abs(gene_a))
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r

sort(gene_a, decreasing = TRUE)[[1]] # "rank" option selects the 1st value when sorted
```

    ## [1] 5

The code above highlights the importance of assessing which selection
method is most appropriate for your data. Multiplied over hundreds of
cases of non-1:1 mapping, the chosen measurement filtering method can
have a notable impact on GSEA data.

After applying the filtering technique described above to the example
rank vector, the results should look like this:

    ##       KLK3        PZP     SPINT3        CGA       FSHB      ENPP2 
    ## -14.541600  14.285305 -13.307083   9.528913   9.528913   8.862328 
    ##        LHB   DEFB104A     CRISP2       CGB3 
    ##   8.709291  -8.141046  -8.096695   7.895289

No duplicate genes or “\|”-delimited heterodimers remain in the preview
of the ranking vector.

This filtering procedure is performed for all genes in the input ranked
vector, and the filtered vector will then be used as input for GSEA.

The output of
[`somaPrGSEA()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/somaPrGSEA.md)
will include this filtered and modified vector, for reference.

## Summary

- The SomaScan menu contains **non-1:1 relationships** between SOMAmer
  Reagents and their target proteins/genes, which can complicate
  gene-centric analyses like GSEA
- **Delimited identifiers** (e.g., “GENE1\|GENE2”) must be split so each
  symbol can be properly matched to gene sets
- **SomaLogic recommends keeping analyte measurements distinct** rather
  than collapsing or aggregating them by gene — this preserves valuable
  information about protein isoforms and regions
- SomaEnrich automatically handles non-1:1 relationships by **selecting
  a single “best” measurement** per gene, rather than summing
  measurements together
- **“Best”** measurement can be defined in various ways, and a few
  options are provided to do this automatically
- The R functions
  [`prepareRanks()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/prepareRanks.md),
  [`somaPrGSEA()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/somaPrGSEA.md),
  and
  [`somaORA()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/somaORA.md)
  are capable of performing these processing steps

Please keep in mind that these processing steps are an *optional*
feature, and ultimately you must decide if they are appropriate for your
analysis.
