#' Perform Overrepresentation Analysis for SomaScan
#'
#' @description
#'   Implements the algorithm from [fgsea::fora()] to perform
#'   overrepresentation analysis (ORA) via hypergeometric test, tailored
#'   specifically to proteomic SomaScan data.
#'
#' @section Additional Details:
#'   Overrepresentation analysis is a statistical method that determines
#'   whether sets of features, often genes, are present in a data set
#'   more than would be expected by chance. As an example, imagine a SomaScan
#'   experiment in which 200 analytes are determined to be differentially
#'   expressed in a group of breast cancer samples. Using ORA, a
#'   researcher can investigate whether any pathways, like cellular
#'   proliferation, are more highly represented in those 200 analytes than
#'   would be expected by chance.
#'
#' @section Feature Selection: 
#'   The primary input to ORA is a set of biological features of interest.
#'   Selecting these features typically involves defining a specific subset,
#'   often differentially expressed genes, based on previously defined
#'   thresholds or cutoffs. For example, one could use the combined statistical
#'   significance and log fold change (logFC) cutoffs of p < 0.05 and
#'   logFC > 2, respectively, to identify significantly differentially
#'   expressed genes. This list would then be used as input for ORA. Please
#'   note that the most appropriate cutoff(s) to use will likely vary by
#'   experiment; this is only an example.
#'
#' @section Enrichment Universe:
#'   The `universe` (sometimes referred to as "background") serves as a point
#'   of reference against which the genes or analytes of interest (provided to
#'   `features`) can be compared. Setting the correct background universe is
#'   _crucial_ for accurate ORA results. The universe must encompass all
#'   features in the analysis results (typically differential expression
#'   analysis). If analyte filtering was performed prior to differential
#'   expression analysis, the filtered analytes should not be used to set the
#'   ORA universe.
#'
#'   If `features` contains elements that are not in `universe`, those
#'   elements will be dropped from `features`. Additionally, `universe`
#'   elements that are not found in any gene set will be dropped. 
#'
#' @section Handling Heterodimers:
#'   When a SOMAmer Reagent targets a protein heterodimer, the genes associated
#'   with that heterodimer are collapsed using a delimiter character
#'   (ex. "CGA|CGB3|CGB7") for concise display in the SomaScan menu. However,
#'   when performing ORA, these collapsed and delimited strings must be split
#'   into individual gene symbols, so each symbol can be matched against
#'   gene-based databases like GO or MSigDB. In SomaEnrich, the `resource` or
#'   `cust_paths` arguments direct annotation of the features of interest to
#'   known pathways or gene sets. If the elements of `features` do not match
#'   elements in `resource`/`cust_paths`, the non-matching elements in
#'   `features`/`universe` will be dropped. Consequently, to preserve these
#'   elements, the default behavior is to split delimited strings.

#' @param features Character. A vector containing features of interest, often
#'   differentially expressed genes or SomaScan analytes. Vector elements must
#'   be either Entrez gene symbols/identifiers (unless custom gene sets are 
#'   used, see `cust_paths`) or SomaScan identifiers in R-compatible 
#'   `AptName` format (e.g. `seq.1234.56`). If using `AptNames`, you must set 
#'   `use_aptnames = TRUE`.
#' @param id_type Character. Type of gene identifier used in `features`.
#'   Options are "EntrezGeneSymbol" or "EntrezGeneID". Default is 
#'   "EntrezGeneSymbol". Ignored if `use_aptnames = TRUE`.
#' @param split_ids Logical. If the identifiers used in the `features` and
#'   `universe` vectors contain heterodimers (elements separated by a
#'   delimiter, like `"GENE1|GENE2"`), should the heterodimers be split into
#'   individual components, like `c("GENE1", "GENE2")`? If TRUE (the default),
#'   this may introduce duplicate identifiers into `features`/`universe`.
#'   Applies to _both_ `features` and `universe`. See `Details` and examples.
#' @param unique_features Logical. If present, should duplicates in
#'   `features` be removed? Default is FALSE. If TRUE, the resultant
#'   vector will only contain unique elements. The duplicated features are
#'   often the result of setting `split_ids = TRUE` when heterodimers
#'   are present in the `features` vector. See examples.
#' @param universe Character. A vector of unique gene symbols or `AptNames`.
#'   This vector represents the overall "universe" from which the elements in
#'   `features` were identified. The `universe` should encompass _all_
#'   elements in the differential expression analysis from which the set of
#'   over-represented targets (`features`) was chosen. See `Details` for more
#'   information.
#'   If using `AptNames`, you must set `use_aptnames = TRUE`.
#' @returns An object of class `somaORA` (inheriting from `data.frame`)
#'   containing the results of ORA, where the results in each row correspond
#'   to a single tested pathway. The data frame contains the following columns:
#' \item{resource_code}{Abbreviated character string representing the name 
#'                      of the original gene set resource.}
#' \item{pathway_id}{Pathway identifier/accession number from the original
#'                   gene set or pathway resource.}
#' \item{pathway}{Name of the pathway.}
#' \item{pval}{An enrichment p-value from hypergeometric test.}
#' \item{padj}{The BH-adjusted p-value.}
#' \item{foldEnrichment}{The degree of enrichment, relative to the background.}
#' \item{overlap}{The size of the overlap between the pathway and features of interest.}
#' \item{size}{The size of the pathway.}
#' \item{overlapFeatures}{A vector containing the overlapping features (see 'overlap' column).}
#'
#' By default, the data frame is sorted by the BH-adjusted p-value and fold
#' enrichment.
