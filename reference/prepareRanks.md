# Prepare Ranking Metrics for SomaScan-Based Enrichment Analyses

Resolves instances of identifier duplication in SomaScan datasets,
typically resulting from many-to-one relationships between SOMAmer
Reagents and their protein targets. This duplication is often
encountered when preparing a statistical ranking metric for pre-ranked
GSEA, or (more generally) converting SomaScan analyte
measurements/statistics to the gene level.

This function will ensure that the provided data only has one numeric
value per unique feature (typically genes), and in cases of duplication,
a single value will be selected to represent each gene.

## Usage

``` r
prepareRanks(
  stats,
  features,
  split_ids = TRUE,
  resolve_multimapping = TRUE,
  resolve_method = c("abs", "min", "max", "rank"),
  verbose = interactive()
)
```

## Arguments

- stats:

  Vector of a numeric statistic. This vector will be used to rank
  features, according to the value of the statistic. Any numeric metric
  may be used (t-statistic, p-value, fold change, etc.). When
  `resolve_method = "rank"`, the most important or highly valued
  features should be sorted *first*. This may require values to be
  ordered in ascending or descending order, depending on the metric
  used. For example, p-values should be sorted in ascending order, with
  smaller values indicating higher importance, while fold-change values
  could be sorted in descending order, with larger positive values
  indicating higher importance.

- features:

  Character. Identifiers that correspond to the statistical metric in
  `stats`, often SomaScan `AptNames` or genes.

- split_ids:

  Logical. If the identifiers used for the statistical metric contain
  heterodimers (features separated by a delimiter, like
  `"GENE1|GENE2"`), should the heterodimers be split into individual
  components, like `c("GENE1", "GENE2")`? If TRUE (the default), the
  final ranking metric will contain duplicated numeric values, one for
  each unique member of the heterodimer. See `Details` and examples.

- resolve_multimapping:

  Logical. Should many-to-one relationships between SOMAmer Reagents and
  genes (i.e. multiple SOMAmer Reagents mapping to the same gene) in the
  statistical ranking metric be resolved? Default is TRUE. Only one
  entry per gene will be retained, based on the `resolve_method`
  selection criteria. See `Details`.

- resolve_method:

  Character. Selection method for choosing a single representative value
  for a gene when non-1:1 mapping exists between analytes and genes.
  Choose one of:

  "abs"

  :   (Default) Selects the entry with the largest absolute value per
      gene. Recommended for signed statistics (e.g. t-statistic, log
      fold change) in bidirectional analyses — unlike `"rank"` or
      `"max"`, it preserves strong signal symmetrically at both the top
      and bottom of the ranking vector.

  "min"

  :   Selects the entry with the minimum numeric value, including
      negative values. Use for metrics where smaller values are better
      (e.g., p-values) or when smaller/negative signed values are
      important.

  "max"

  :   Selects the entry with the maximum numeric value. Use for metrics
      where larger values are preferred (e.g. positive one-sided tests).

  "rank"

  :   Selects the entry with the smallest positional index (i.e. first
      occurrence in the input vector). Use when input is pre-sorted by
      one or more variables, and the "best" entry is the one closest to
      position 1. This means that the selected entry depends on the
      order of the input, so `ranks` must be **pre-sorted** to place
      values of highest importance first.

- verbose:

  Logical. Should progress messages be printed to the console? By
  default, messages will only be shown in interactive R sessions. Set to
  TRUE to show all messages, and FALSE to silence messages.

## Value

A named numeric vector of statistics, with unique element names. This
vector is suitable for input into
[`somaPrGSEA()`](https://somalogic.github.io/SomaEnrich/reference/somaPrGSEA.md),
or other gene-based analytical methods.

## SOMAmer Reagent and Target Relationships

Non-1:1 mapping between SOMAmer Reagents and their targets is a known
characteristic of the SomaScan menu. This can lead to a single gene
being associated with multiple statistical metric results. For example,
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and its associated gene, KLK3, are
targeted by 4 SOMAmer Reagents in the 7K SomaScan menu. This means that,
*at the gene level*, KLK3 has 4 RFU values in any 7K SomaScan data set.

In pre-ranked GSEA, however, values in the input ranking data must be
unique. Therefore, the input data cannot contain 4 measurements for
PSA - only one must be chosen to be representative of the KLK3 gene.
There are many acceptable selection methods, and the most appropriate
one will depend on your question and/or experimental design. See the
analyte-to-gene mapping vignette
(`browseVignettes(package = "SomaEnrich")`) for more details.

## Ties in the Ranking Metric

When a SOMAmer Reagent targets a protein heterodimer, the genes
associated with that heterodimer are collapsed using a delimiter
character (ex. "CGA\|CGB3\|CGB7") for concise display in the SomaScan
menu. However, when performing GSEA, the collapsed and delimited gene
identifier must be split into individual gene symbols, so each symbol
can be matched against gene-based databases like GO or MSigDB. Splitting
a single analyte into multiple genes requires duplicating the ranking
metric value across all resultant genes (ex. `c("GENE1|GENE2" = 1)`
becomes `c("GENE1" = 1, "GENE2" = 1`). This can introduce ties into the
ranked input vector; however, this is *expected* behavior. The tied
values indicate that there is insufficient information to rank the genes
that were co-measured as part of the same protein complex. See the
analyte-to-gene mapping vignette
(`browseVignettes(package = "SomaEnrich")`) for more details.
